# Naive-Bayes

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' Theorem and assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label. This "naive" assumption simplifies the computation and makes the algorithm very efficient.

Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes that the continuous features follow a Gaussian distribution.
2. Multinomial Naive Bayes: Used for discrete features such as word counts in text classification.
3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Used for binary/boolean features.
